## Video platform simulation

This program simulates a video streaming platform similar to e.g. Youtube.
*Channel* users post videos, as well as launch streams, which can be watched and "liked" by other users. 
Each user has their own queue of videos to watch and a list of channels they are subscribed to.

## How to launch

Download the latest release from GitHub, unpack the .zip file and in the unpacked directory execute ```java -jar VideoPlatformSimulation.jar```
